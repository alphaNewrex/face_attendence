# Microsoft Engage'22
## Final Project - Face Attendance
### ðŸš©Problem Statement 
Develop a browser-based
application or a native mobile
application to demonstrate 
application of Face Recognition 
technology.

For this, I decided my Problem statement to be **Tracking Attendance**.
The problem of marking attendance in an offline or even online medium of school/college is very tiresome, wherein the teacher circulates a sheet and everyone has to sign or the teacher manually calls out names and this is very time taking and resource expensive.
To Automate and digitize this process I decided to come up with a solution that is both effective and easy to use by everyone.

Now, you can mark attendance of you class by just one click in the Face Attendance App, where it automatically detects the faces and sends it to Microsoft Cognitive Services and returns us with updated attendance on screen.

Cherry on the top is that you can mark attendance of more than one student at a time (10 students maximum in one image, i.e. this is the limit given to us by Microsoft Azure Face API - Identify).


P.S. This project was built entirely during the Microsoft Engage'22 Program Timeline.
